/** Class to allow interactive zooming and panning of the Processing display. To use, simply
 *  create a ZoomPan object in setup(), then call its transform() method at the start of 
 *  draw(). Panning is controlled with the right mouse button dragging. Zooming is, by 
 *  default, controlled with a left mouse drag up to zoom in, left-drag down to zoom out. 
 *  Can also zoom in and out with the mouse wheel if present. Mouse actions can be filtered
 *  so that they only work if a modifier key is pressed (ALT, SHIFT or CONTROL) by calling
 *  the setMouseMask() method.
